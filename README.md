# 🧠 Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition ✍️

This project implements Neural Networks to recognize handwritten digits using different frameworks — TensorFlow, PyTorch, and NumPy.
It includes both binary (0 vs 1) and multiclass (0–9) classification tasks.

# 📘 Overview

The goal is to understand how neural networks learn to classify image data through multiple implementations and compare their behaviors across frameworks.

# 🧩 Contents
